This project involves fine-tuning a BERT model for detecting 10-digit numbers in video frames. Using PyTorch and Hugging Face's Transformers, the model is trained on labeled text data. A Streamlit app facilitates video uploads, frame extraction, OCR processing with PyTesseract, and real-time pattern detection.
